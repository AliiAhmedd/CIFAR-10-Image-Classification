# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification
Developed two models for classifying animals and vehicles. The first one being a baseline Multi-layer perceptron and the second one, a deeper neural network where I used regularization techniques such as weight decay, batch normalization and dropout. The Adam optimizer was also used for both models, instead of the dtandard gradient descent
